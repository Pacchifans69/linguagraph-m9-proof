# LinguaGraph M9 external proof

This repository is independent proof infrastructure for **M9 — Grapheme-Safe
Native Selection Capture**. It must not modify the LinguaGraph Product repository.

```

The provider tuple and OSS role/config mechanics were inherited from M8 and then
independently revalidated for M9 by a Human-authorized read-only provider
rediscovery on 2026-09-28. This provider-rebind landing records
`M9_PROVIDER_BINDING_READY=YES` without changing any expected tuple, config or
OSS target value. It does not issue a formal authorization, create a claim or
execute Gate 2. No M8 authorization, token, claim, receipt, or spent namespace
is valid for M9.

Two M9 predecessor authorizations are spent and must never be reused. **RUN-01**
(`M9-EXI-01-RUN-0aae75d8-01`) was issued but never claimed — its formal
invocation was never sent, so its capability is lost. **RUN-02**
(`M9-EXI-01-RUN-0aae75d8-02`) was claimed with no closure receipt
(INDETERMINATE), and its single formal invocation failed closed on the
predecessor candidate hygiene defect that the Product successor
`fbbb1316ebae90c464779b43e75376dfe02160e6` corrects. Neither may be
re-presented, claimed, re-run or durability-retried, and this proof successor
carries no issued authorization, no claim and no receipt.

## Exact Product binding

```

The provider-neutral core fails closed unless remote branch/main, detached
checkout, tree, unique parent, frozen-main ancestry, and the reviewed 14-file
candidate scope all match exactly.

Preparation-time suite guards are expectations, not proof results:

```text

Vitest:                 561 passed
M9 targeted Vitest:     113 passed
Playwright:              35 passed
```

M9 targeted evidence maps G-01…G-12, S-01…S-11-equivalent and
T-01…T-10-equivalent semantics to exact test titles. Retained M7 concurrency
and M8 R-G01…R-G21 routing evidence remain predecessor regressions.

## R2B formal lifecycle

There is exactly **one** formal entrypoint:

```text
scripts/run-m9-proof.sh
```

`scripts/run-m9-proof-alibaba-ecs.sh` is a thin execution adapter, not an
independent formal runner. Without wrapper-issued formal context and the durable
single-use claim it refuses to consume any authorization, refuses to invoke the
semantic core, and is reported as `NONFORMAL / NOT_APPLICABLE`.

```text
pre-claim guards -> OSS trust-target establishment (read-only) -> atomic claim
                 -> PHASE A execution -> PHASE B seal -> PHASE C durability
                 -> PHASE D commit -> terminal RC marker
```

Every pre-claim guard, and every trust-target establishment step, is read-only.
No `PutObject` may occur before all of them succeed; the first permitted mutating
call of a formal run is the atomic claim.

### Frozen RC contract

Four distinct statuses exist and none may substitute for another:

| Artifact | Meaning | Writer |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `core-exit-code.txt` | actual process RC of `run-m9-proof-core.sh` as observed by its parent adapter | adapter, immediately after the core child returns |
| `adapter-exit-code.txt` | adapter's final self-declared RC after all adapter work | adapter `EXIT` trap |
| `formal-execution-rc.txt` | actual adapter-child RC observed by the wrapper | wrapper, immediately after the adapter child returns |
| `closure-receipt.json.formal_command_rc` | final successful formal wrapper RC (must be 0) | wrapper, PHASE D |

The semantic core never writes `core-exit-code.txt`, and refuses to start if a
stale one already exists.

The wrapper requires `adapter-exit-code.txt == formal-execution-rc.txt`, both
present and numeric. Absent, empty, non-numeric or mismatching records **FAIL
CLOSED**. `SIGTERM` is recorded as its own numeric RC; `SIGKILL` cannot run an
in-process trap, so the adapter RC is simply absent and the wrapper fails closed
rather than fabricating it.

### Pre-claim provider identity

`scripts/lib/m9-provider-identity.sh` carries the exact immutable provider
tuple independently revalidated for M9 on 2026-09-28. The reviewed repository
binding is recorded by `M9_PROVIDER_BINDING_READY=YES`; the tuple values
themselves are unchanged from the inherited M8 candidate. The reviewed tuple is:

```text
instance ID:   i-j6c9854oyawy89fcdxy2
region:        cn-hongkong
zone:          cn-hongkong-d
instance type: ecs.g9i.xlarge
image ID:      ubuntu_24_04_x64_20G_alibase_20260916.vhd

identity document SHA-256:
60f62ad9f4c10aab718bdc6dfdf0c57e1e4ced293908417009df8e4b7dbdaa1d
identity PKCS7 SHA-256:
89185b286e03b344a5ca7e2f3a242baf4b454419dab0cd83ec3426981860d211
```

Required order: local token syntax (the presented token is hashed to
`authorization_sha256` and is never echoed), durable `issued.json` retrieval and
binding validation, static bindings, read-only provider identity verification,
and only then the atomic claim. The adapter independently repeats the same
read-only verification after the claim and requires the observed tuple to equal
the claim's, as defence in depth before invoking the core.

Network addresses (VPC, vSwitch, private IPv4, EIP) are recorded as provenance
but are not part of the immutable execution identity.

The same library performs the read-only ECS RAM **role-name** observation used to
pin the OSS auth mode, querying only the role-name LIST endpoint
(`meta-data/ram/security-credentials/`) and never the credential-payload
endpoint. The **expected** role name is proof-tree pinned by the canonical config
below. During the 2026-09-28 M9 read-only rediscovery, the **actual** attached
role was observed as `LinguaGraphM8ProofExecutor` and cross-bound exactly
against that pin. Every future preflight or formal invocation must still observe
the live role afresh and cross-bind it; the reviewed observation is evidence for
the repository binding, not a bypass of the runtime guard.

### OSS object model

```text
authorizations/<authorization_sha256>/issued.json
authorizations/<authorization_sha256>/claim.json
runs/<proof_sha>/<semantic_auth_sha256>/<archive_name>
runs/<proof_sha>/<semantic_auth_sha256>/package-index.json
runs/<proof_sha>/<semantic_auth_sha256>/closure-receipt.json
```

`<authorization_sha256>` is `SHA256(exact Human-issued authorization TOKEN)`.
The Human supplies the exact token string in `M9_PROOF_RUN_AUTHORIZATION`
(semantic) or `M9_PROOF_RETRY_AUTHORIZATION` (durability retry); the wrapper
hashes it locally and only the digest becomes an object-path component. The token
itself is never printed, persisted, uploaded, recorded in a receipt or package
index, or written into `ossutil` command output. `issued.json` must **declare**
the same `authorization_sha256`, and a mismatched declaration **FAILS CLOSED**.

`authorization_sha256` is deliberately **not** a digest of the `issued.json`
bytes: there is no self-reference, and a document can never contain a correct
digest of its own bytes. Exact issued-document byte identity, when wanted, is
carried by the separate and semantically distinct `issued_document_sha256` field
of the closure receipt, which the wrapper computes over the exact retrieved
bytes and cross-binds in both directions. Run paths and archive names are
derived canonically, never supplied by the caller.

Every write is atomic create-if-absent through the official ossutil API, and
every upload body uses the official **file form**:

```bash
ossutil api put-object --bucket "$BUCKET" --key "$KEY" \
  --body "file://$FILE" --forbid-overwrite true
```

A bare local path (`--body "$FILE"`) is not the file-body form and is never
used. For an absolute path such as `/tmp/foo.tar.gz` the resulting argument is
`file:///tmp/foo.tar.gz`.

`HEAD`-then-unconditional-`PUT` is never used as the locking primitive, ETag is
never treated as SHA-256, and `FileAlreadyExists` is never overwritten.

`GetObject` stays byte-exact, but **not** because a bare stdout redirection is
sufficient. The response body travels directly from ossutil stdout into a file
and never through shell command substitution, a shell variable or a textual
parser. On top of that, live ossutil **2.4.0** writes a **non-body** elapsed
footer (`\n0.089713(s) elapsed\n`, 21 bytes) to ordinary `get-object` stdout, so
a plain `> file` redirection is **not** byte-exact on its own. Production
therefore frames the read with `get-object --quiet`, which live evidence
established suppresses that client epilogue while leaving the response-body bytes
identical. The manifest and archive digests are computed over those exact file
bytes.

The proof harness **never installs ossutil**; host provisioning supplies it. A
capability guard must demonstrate support for
`ossutil api put-object --forbid-overwrite true`, `get-object`, `head-object`,
`get-bucket-versioning` and `get-bucket-location`, **and** for the five pinned
global flags listed under *OSS trust target* below, **and** for the
`get-object --quiet` response-framing flag; otherwise the wrapper fails closed.
`--quiet` is a GetObject **framing/capability** requirement, **not** a sixth
CLI-pinned trust target: it is never added to the pinned global vector, and a
client that does not demonstrate it is rejected.

### OSS trust target (proof-tree role-bound config + CLI-pinned network target)

The trust model is `PROOF_TREE_PINNED_IMDSV2_ECS_ROLE` +
`CLI_PINNED_OSS_NETWORK_TARGET`. Ambient configuration is impossible by
construction:

```bash
ossutil --config-file <proof-tree config> \
  --region cn-hongkong \
  --endpoint https://oss-cn-hongkong-internal.aliyuncs.com \
  --addressing-style virtual --ignore-env-var \
  api <operation> ...
```

There is deliberately **no CLI `--mode` and no CLI `--ecs-role-name`**. Live
runtime on the bound host proved that ossutil **2.4.0** supports neither:
`--ecs-role-name` is rejected as `unknown flag`, and `Ali-EcsRamRole` is rejected
through CLI `--mode` as `invalid value for flag(s) "mode"`. The captured 2.4.0
help declares the CLI `--mode` valid set as exactly
`"AK","StsToken","EcsRamRole","Anonymous"`; `Ali-EcsRamRole` and `RamRoleArn` are
both outside it, so no CLI mode can express this trust target. The role binding
therefore lives in the proof-tree canonical config and is cross-bound before any
network access.

- **Endpoint.** The frozen endpoint is the HTTPS **in-region internal** endpoint
  (`endpoint_class=INTERNAL`, `network_policy=SAME_REGION_INTERNAL_ONLY`). No
  public, cross-region or caller-selected endpoint is ever used.
- **Authentication.** The config selects `mode=Ali-EcsRamRole`, so the official
  ossutil `Ali-EcsRamRole` credential provider authenticates the call. That
  provider **may internally retrieve temporary credentials through IMDSv2** —
  this document does not claim otherwise. Our harness never prints, persists or
  places those credential values in evidence, and never carries an AK/SK, STS
  token or explicit RAM role ARN: `--access-key-id`, `--access-key-secret`,
  `--sts-token`, `--ram-role-arn` and `--role-session-name` are structurally
  absent, and TLS verification is never disabled (`--skip-verify-cert` is never
  used).
- **Role binding — two independent authorities.** The binding is *not* weakened
  by losing the CLI flag; it moves to a verified chain:
  1. the durable provider helper (`scripts/lib/m9-provider-identity.sh`) observes
     the attached role **read-only** from the IMDSv2 role-name LIST endpoint
     (`meta-data/ram/security-credentials/`) — zero roles, multiple roles,
     control characters, a CR, a NUL or a path-like value all fail closed, and
     the credential-payload endpoint is never requested;
  2. the proof-tree config supplies `ecsRoleName`;
  3. the stored observed role must equal the config role;
  4. before **every** network-capable call, the fresh live observation must equal
     **both** the stored observed role and the config role.
  Any disagreement, or a missing durable provider helper, fails closed **before**
  ossutil is invoked. There is no fallback to the stored value.
- **Configuration.** `scripts/config/m9-ossutil-formal.ini` is a **proof-tree
  role-bound config** (81 bytes) with a frozen SHA-256:
  `[default]` + `language=EN` + `mode=Ali-EcsRamRole` +
  `ecsRoleName=LinguaGraphM8ProofExecutor`, and nothing else. It must be a
  regular, non-symlinked, in-worktree file with exactly that byte identity; the
  guard also establishes that the config auth mode equals the frozen auth mode and
  that the config role is non-empty. There is **no fallback** to
  `~/.ossutilconfig` or to any caller-selected profile.
- **Closed environment.** Nineteen ambient OSS/credential/proxy variable names
  constitute a closed trust environment
  (`m9-oss-env-closed/v1`). If any one is set — including
  `M9_OSSUTIL_CONFIG_FILE`, every `OSS_*` credential and endpoint selector,
  `OSSUTIL_CONFIG_FILE`, `OSSUTIL_PROFILE`, `ALIBABA_CLOUD_ECS_METADATA` and the
  upper- and lower-case proxy families — the entrypoint **FAILS CLOSED** before
  any provider access, authorization processing, host-state or evidence write,
  naming the offending variable but never echoing its value. This is a separate
  authority from the seven synthetic override seams; the two lists are never
  merged. `--ignore-env-var` additionally makes the pinned CLI ignore
  `OSS_`-prefixed variables.
- **ossutil identity.** The resolved `ossutil` must be an executable regular
  file; its absolute path, parsed `major.minor.patch` version and SHA-256 of the
  resolved bytes are recorded at runtime. Versions below **2.2.0** (the floor
  for `--ignore-env-var`) and unparseable banners fail closed.
- **Bucket location.** A read-only `GetBucketLocation` must report the frozen
  region; otherwise the run fails closed **before any `PutObject`**.

#### OSS trust profile

The observed bindings are serialized into an 18-record `key=value` profile
(`linguagraph-m9-oss-trust-profile/v1`) in a frozen field order, UTF-8, one LF
per record and exactly one final LF, with no CR, NUL or BOM. Its digest is
`SHA256` of those exact bytes — never a caller-supplied value and never a JSON
canonicalization. The digest is bound before the claim:

1. the future Human-issued authorization must declare the same
   `oss_trust_profile_sha256` (missing, malformed or different fails closed);
2. the atomic `claim.json`, the sealed `package-index.json` and the
   `closure-receipt.json` all carry it, the receipt both at top level and in
   `cross_binding`;
3. `verify-m9-closure-receipt.py` checks both carriers and accepts
   `--expect-oss-trust-profile-sha256` for an independent Human expectation; and
4. a durability retry must observe the same profile as the sealed semantic run,
   and fails closed on any mismatch.

No `PutObject` may occur before every trust-target step has succeeded; the first
permitted mutating call of a formal run is the atomic claim.

#### Expected pins vs. reviewed M9 read-only live bindings

Two classes of value must be kept distinct.

**Repository-known expectations (pinned, but not evidence).** The canonical config
pins the **expected ECS RAM role name** (`LinguaGraphM8ProofExecutor`) together
with the frozen auth mode, and the config's exact 81-byte / SHA-256 identity. The
frozen region, endpoint, endpoint class, network policy, addressing style, auth
mode, TLS policy and closed-environment policy are likewise repository constants.
None of these pins is evidence of anything on the host: they are the *expected*
side of a cross-binding, and a mismatch fails closed rather than authorizing a
call.

On 2026-09-28, a Human-authorized read-only M9 provider rediscovery independently
observed and cross-bound the live trust target against
`b9a6ff23559ed4ecb0b07f0083cd57c62f814e1d` /
`7ca4e864cc7c18a79749c14c761bfb30b076ecd8`. No claim or OSS mutation
occurred:

```

The review did **not** exercise RAM write permission and did **not** query the RAM
policy document from the control plane. Those remain deliberately unproven and
are not mismatches. The live role, ossutil identity, bucket state and trust
profile must still be re-observed and cross-bound by the repository-native
preflight and by any later formal run.

No Gate 2 claim is made by this landing, and this proof successor has no issued
authorization, no claim and no receipt. Gate 2 remains **NOT ESTABLISHED**.

### Critical OSS versioning guard

`x-oss-forbid-overwrite` is only correct on an **unversioned** bucket. Before
any claim, archive, index or receipt `PutObject`, the wrapper queries bucket
versioning read-only and accepts only Unversioned / Null / an equivalent
empty-status API response. `Enabled`, `Suspended`, unknown, unparseable and
access-denied all **FAIL CLOSED**. The harness never changes versioning: it has
no `PutBucketVersioning` authority.

### ISSUER / EXECUTOR authority split (documented, not provisioned)

```text
ISSUER
  may create immutable authorizations/<sha>/issued.json
  needs no other OSS permission

EXECUTOR
  may read issued.json
  may create exactly the claim/run/index/receipt objects required by its
    authorization, with create-if-absent semantics
  may Get / Head objects
  may GetBucketVersioning
  MUST NOT require DeleteObject
  MUST NOT require PutBucketVersioning
  MUST NOT require creation or overwrite of issued.json
```

No RAM/provider policy mutation is authorized or performed by this repository.

### Single-use claim

Before any semantic execution the wrapper retrieves `issued.json` and validates
the authorization kind, the `authorization_sha256` binding to the presented
token digest, proof SHA/tree, candidate SHA/tree/parent, frozen main, provider
identity tuple, authorized executor ID and `single_use=true`. It then creates
`claim.json` atomically. An existing claim **FAILS CLOSED**: there is no expiry,
takeover, lease, fencing-token renewal or re-arming. A claim with no valid
receipt is **INDETERMINATE** for authorization-governance purposes, and the same
semantic authorization can never be rerun.

### Execution / seal / durability / commit

* **PHASE A** executes the adapter, cross-checks the RC records, requires a
  `PASS` outcome and validates strict artifact closure: the actual regular files
  in the evidence root, minus the seal-phase `artifact-manifest.sha256`, must
  equal the canonical required set exactly. A missing required artifact and an
  unexpected/unclassified artifact are both fatal.
* **PHASE B** generates `artifact-manifest.sha256`, validates that the manifest
  entry set equals the required set exactly and that every recorded digest
  matches the file on disk, creates exactly one deterministic canonical archive,
  and generates `package-index.json` locally exactly once. The pre-existing
  deterministic tar/gzip semantics are retained; archive file modes are **not**
  normalised in R2. After the archive digest is fixed, the archive, manifest,
  execution artifacts, `outcome.txt` and `package-index.json` are never mutated
  or rebuilt.
* **PHASE C** uploads create-if-absent and reads back: object size, archive
  SHA-256, embedded artifact manifest, and `package-index.json` contents. A
  durability failure produces **no** receipt.
* **PHASE D** constructs the canonical `closure-receipt.json` locally, creates it
  with no-overwrite, reads it back and requires the fetched bytes/SHA-256 to
  equal the locally constructed receipt exactly. Only then is
  `formal_command_rc` parsed, required to be `0`, and
  `M9_FORMAL_RUN_COMMAND_RC=0` printed. Any byte/hash mismatch fails closed
  and prints no formal RC.

The receipt records only `closure_outcome=PASS`; there is no FAIL or
INDETERMINATE receipt. Failure state is "claim exists, receipt absent". The
receipt carries no redundant `terminal_line` field: the terminal marker is
emitted once by the wrapper process and is not embedded in the receipt.

Receipt self-consistency is enforced by `cross_binding.*` fields which mirror
the sealed archive digest, the archive digest recorded inside the package index,
the manifest digest, the exact issued-document digest and the claim digest.
`authorization_sha256` itself is the token identity and is never mirrored as an
"authorization object" digest, because it is not one.

### Artifact completeness (strict set closure)

`scripts/verify-m9-artifact-completeness.py` owns two explicit responsibilities;
presence-only checking is not sufficient and is not what is implemented.

```text
A. required-set validation (pre-seal)
   scripts/lib/m9-required-artifacts.txt is parsed as a canonical EXPLICIT
   relative-path set. Duplicate entries, absolute paths, '.', '..', any '..'
   traversal component, empty components, './' prefixes, backslash separators
   and shell-glob entries are rejected. Blank/comment lines are ignored
   deterministically. The reserved manifest name may not be listed.

B. pre-seal actual-set closure
   actual regular files under the evidence root, minus artifact-manifest.sha256,
   must EQUAL the required set exactly:
     * missing required file            -> FAIL CLOSED
     * unexpected/unclassified file     -> FAIL CLOSED
   The archive, archive sidecar, package-index.json and closure-receipt.json are
   seal/commit outputs outside the evidence root and are never members.

C. manifest set/hash validation (post-manifest)
   every manifest path must be relative, normalized, non-traversing and
   non-duplicated; the manifest must not hash itself; the manifest entry set
   must equal the required set exactly; and every recorded digest must equal the
   SHA-256 of the actual file. Any mismatch -> FAIL CLOSED.
```

The Python verifier is the completeness authority. `m9_manifest_verify` in
`scripts/lib/m9-manifest.sh` remains as an additional byte-identical recompute
defence after sealing; it does not replace the set/hash validation above.

### Committed re-invocation

If a valid closure receipt already exists for an authorization, the wrapper does
not re-execute, does not re-emit the formal RC marker and does not return a
synthetic success: it hard-refuses with a distinct `ALREADY_COMMITTED`
diagnostic and a non-zero status. Read-only historical verification belongs to
`scripts/verify-m9-closure-receipt.py`, not to the wrapper.

### Durability retry

A durability retry requires a distinct authorization with
`authorization_kind=DURABILITY_RETRY` and a new authorization hash, whose
`issued.json` binds the semantic authorization SHA, proof SHA/tree, exact
canonical run path, expected archive SHA-256, expected package-index SHA-256 and
authorized executor ID. A retry may only read the pre-existing exact sealed
archive and package index, verify the bound digests, upload missing canonical
objects create-if-absent, read back, verify and create the one canonical closure
receipt if eligible. It must never rerun the core or adapter, modify evidence or
outcome, modify the manifest, rebuild the archive, regenerate the package index,
or reuse a semantic authorization. If the package index is missing locally, or
the archive is missing locally and not already durably present, the retry is not
eligible and stops for Human reconciliation.

## M9 targeted Vitest runtime evidence

Before the full Vitest suite, the semantic core executes exactly the three M9
test files and writes a machine-readable Vitest JSON report. The verifier
requires exactly **113 passed tests**, exact file counts 13 / 54 / 46, zero
failed/pending tests, and all 33 G/S/T contract requirements from
`scripts/lib/m9-targeted-test-map.json`. This supplements full Vitest.

## Playwright runtime evidence

The Product's `playwright.config.ts` is not touched. Formal invocation keeps the
seven frozen specs and exports:

```bash
export CI=1
export PLAYWRIGHT_JSON_OUTPUT_FILE="$EVIDENCE/playwright-json-report.json"

npx playwright test \
  <seven exact specs> \
  --retries=0 --fail-on-flaky-tests --reporter=list,json
```

Exactly one `--reporter` option is used. Two distinct namespaces are involved and
must not be conflated.

**CLI invocation namespace.** The formal core executes Playwright from
`<candidate>/apps/web`, so the seven selectors passed to `npx playwright test`
are cwd-relative and retain the `e2e/` prefix:

```text
e2e/golden-path.spec.ts
e2e/unicode.spec.ts
e2e/segmentation.spec.ts
e2e/token-segmentation.spec.ts
e2e/lemma-annotation.spec.ts
e2e/pos-annotation.spec.ts
e2e/workbench-information-architecture.spec.ts
```

**Playwright testDir-relative JSON reporter namespace.** The frozen Product
config sets `testDir: './e2e'`, so for live Playwright 1.62.1 the JSON reporter's
suite `file` values are testDir-relative and omit the `e2e/` prefix:

```text
golden-path.spec.ts

The exact JSON report is parsed with Python stdlib by
`scripts/verify-m9-playwright-json.py`, which requires every
`config.projects[*].retries == 0`, project names `== {"chromium"}`,
`stats.expected == 35`, `stats.unexpected == 0`, `stats.flaky == 0` and
`stats.skipped == 0`, and that the report's spec-file set equals the seven frozen
reporter paths exactly, as an **exact set** in that reporter namespace. The
verifier performs no prefix stripping, no suffix matching, no basename
extraction and no alternate-namespace acceptance: `e2e/golden-path.spec.ts`,
`apps/web/e2e/golden-path.spec.ts` and `vendor/golden-path.spec.ts` all remain
distinct from `golden-path.spec.ts`, so a duplicated basename elsewhere cannot be
accepted and neither namespace is a compatibility fallback for the other. Only
then is `playwright-effective-retries.txt` atomically written with exactly
`PLAYWRIGHT_EFFECTIVE_RETRIES=0`. A missing, unparseable or mismatching report
fails closed. Raw-log count guards are secondary only.

## Preparation-time suite guards

These are guards for the bound Product tree, not proof results:

```text
pytest:                 602 passed
Vitest:                 561 passed
M9 targeted Vitest:     113 passed
Playwright:              35 passed
```

A formal run must actually produce those results. The frontend stage also runs
the three retained M8 routing-focused Vitest files with the verbose reporter and fails
closed unless every frozen routing label `R-G01` through `R-G21` appears in
executed test output. The backend JUnit proof retains all 15 M7 PostgreSQL
concurrency cases.

## Harness

```

Independent M9 namespaces:

```text
evidence env:       M9_PROOF_EVIDENCE_DIR
semantic auth env:  M9_PROOF_RUN_AUTHORIZATION       (exact authorization TOKEN)
retry auth env:     M9_PROOF_RETRY_AUTHORIZATION     (exact retry TOKEN)
executor env:       M9_EXECUTOR_ID                   (alibaba-ecs:<instance-id>)
host state env:     M9_PROOF_HOST_STATE
fixed host state:   ~/.local/state/linguagraph-m9-proof
PostgreSQL name:    linguagraph-m9-proof-postgres
```

No M6/M7 authorization or spent-token namespace is valid here.

## Offline / synthetic verification

```bash
bash tests/run-static-verification.sh
```

This runs only `bash -n` checks, structural invariants, Python stdlib fixture
tests, and synthetic shell fixtures against a local stub ossutil. It never calls
a provider API, Alibaba OSS, Playwright, pytest, Vitest or a Product build, and
installs nothing.

The harness exposes a closed set of seven offline synthetic seams, all owned by
`scripts/lib/m9-synthetic-seams.sh`:

```text
M9_SYNTHETIC_TEST_MODE       umbrella offline mode
M9_IMDS_BASE_URL             redirected metadata endpoint
M9_IMDS_CURL_BIN             redirected metadata client executable
M9_OSSUTIL_BIN               stub object-store client
M9_OSSUTIL_GET_OUTPUT_FLAG   alternative get-object response-body flag
M9_ADAPTER_SCRIPT_OVERRIDE   synthetic formal-execution adapter
M9_PYTHON_BIN                alternative interpreter for verifier programs
```

They exist only so the offline verification can drive the same code paths
without a provider. Formal eligibility is exactly:

```text
all listed variables unset      -> eligible
any listed variable non-empty   -> FAIL CLOSED (no claim, no evidence tree,
                                   no canonical object, no formal marker)
```

This synthetic seam authority is **separate** from the nineteen-name closed OSS
trust-environment authority described under *OSS trust target*. Both live in the
same shared library as two distinct arrays and are never merged; the trust
environment is additionally rejected in production, where the synthetic seams
are not.

Both production entrypoints call `m9_reject_synthetic_overrides()` before any
external I/O or host-state mutation: the formal wrapper
(`scripts/run-m9-proof.sh`) as its first action, and the formal execution
adapter (`scripts/run-m9-proof-alibaba-ecs.sh`) before its formal-context
guards, so a redirected metadata client/endpoint or a stub object store can
never impersonate the formal provider identity. Only the offending variable name
is reported; no seam value is printed.

`M9_SYNTHETIC_TEST_MODE=1` additionally requires an explicit `M9_OSSUTIL_BIN`
override (so it cannot silently use the provisioned binary), permits redirected
evidence/host-state paths, and **never** prints
`M9_FORMAL_RUN_COMMAND_RC`; it prints `M9_SYNTHETIC_OUTCOME=OK` instead. It
must never be used with real credentials, and it does not bypass the durable
single-use claim.

The suite reports its results as independent counters so that a green legacy
baseline can never be mistaken for trust-target evidence:

```text
R2E_B01_LEGACY_V01_V40=40/40
R2E_B01_CORRECTION_REGRESSIONS=9/9
R2E_B01_STATIC_CHECKS=11/11
R2E_B01_SYNTHETIC_CHECKS=29/29
R2I_C1_REGRESSIONS=2/2
R2I_C4_B03_REGRESSIONS=12/12
R2I_C7_PROVIDER_BINARY_REGRESSIONS=4/4
R2I_C11_AUTH_PATH_REGRESSIONS=18/18
R2I_C13_GETOBJECT_BYTE_EXACTNESS_REGRESSIONS=8/8
```

`T01..T12` are the R2I-C4/B03 trust-target regressions: the closed
trust-environment set, CLI trust-target pinning, canonical config identity,
ossutil identity and version floor, bucket-location guard, read-only role-name
observation, trust-profile canonicalization and digest sensitivity,
authorization/claim/package-index/receipt binding, receipt verification, retry
trust-target identity, and pre-claim ordering. `P01..P04` are the R2I-C7
binary-safety regressions for the immutable provider identity inputs. `S01..S18`
are the R2I-C11 auth-path regressions: the 81-byte role-bound config identity, the
five-flag CLI vector with no `--mode`/`--ecs-role-name`, the synthetic ossutil's
real 2.4.0 surface, and the three fail-closed cross-binding branches (missing stored role,
stored role ≠ config role, fresh live role ≠ stored/config role, and a missing
durable provider helper with no stored-value fallback) plus the 18-record profile
semantics. The synthetic 2.4.0 CLI surface is modelled exactly, not approximately:
help does not advertise the role flag; an explicit `--ecs-role-name` is rejected as
an unknown flag; the CLI `--mode` valid set is exactly the captured live set
(`AK`, `StsToken`, `EcsRamRole`, `Anonymous`) — no invented mode — so
`Ali-EcsRamRole` and `RamRoleArn` are both rejected as an invalid mode value; and
the credential-free `Anonymous` parser value is exercised only at the parser, never
as an auth path. Each is separately load-bearing: removing its production mechanism
in a scratch copy makes that check fail.

`Y01..Y08` are the R2I-C13 GetObject byte-exactness regressions. They model the
exact live ossutil 2.4.0 framing in the synthetic client (a deterministic 21-byte
`\n0.089713(s) elapsed\n` footer on ordinary stdout, suppressed by `--quiet`) and
prove: plain no-quiet stdout redirection is **not** byte-exact; production
`m9_oss_get_object` frames GetObject with `--quiet`; text and arbitrary binary
payloads (NUL, CR, LF, DEL, `0x80`, `0xFF`) round-trip byte-exactly by `cmp`, byte
count and SHA-256 without the body ever entering shell command substitution; a
client that does not advertise `get-object --quiet` fails **closed** with the
GetObject-quiet reason while the ordinary capability surface still passes; the
existing `M9_OSSUTIL_GET_OUTPUT_FLAG` response-body seam stays byte-exact and
quiet-framed; and absence, non-absence failure, temporary-file cleanup, rename
install and tampered read-back semantics are preserved. `--quiet` remains outside
the five pinned CLI trust-target arguments.

## Mutation boundary

This repository may contain proof harness/evidence logic only. Preparation and
later proof execution do not authorize:

```text
NO Product repository mutation
NO Product main/branch movement
NO PR
NO merge
NO reuse of M6/M7/M8 run authorization
NO unreviewed provider identity substitution
NO OSS bucket/object mutation outside a formally authorized run
NO credential provisioning or RAM policy mutation
```

## Preflight

The M9 provider tuple has completed Human-authorized read-only review, and this
provider-rebind landing records `M9_PROVIDER_BINDING_READY=YES`. The exact
successor must next run `scripts/preflight-m9-alibaba-ecs.sh` on the reviewed
bound ECS host as repository-native read-only validation.

Post-landing validation requires exact changed-scope/content review, complete M9
shell offline verification, the repository-native preflight on the exact bound
host, and an exact SHA/tree/clean-worktree guard. The preflight does not install
packages, bootstrap Docker, consume a one-shot run authorization, create formal
proof evidence, or mutate either GitHub repository or any OSS object. Re-running
it is diagnostic only and does not itself authorize formal execution.

Formal execution of the successor remains **not authorized**. Only after all
post-landing validation passes may a fresh one-shot M9 formal-run authorization
be prepared for separate Human approval.
